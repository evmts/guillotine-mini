## Summary

I've completed a comprehensive audit of the System Call Opcodes (Agent 11) for the guillotine-mini EVM implementation. Here are the key findings:

### Critical Issues Found:

1. **SELFDESTRUCT - EIP-6780 Violation (CRITICAL)**
   - Missing `created_accounts` tracking
   - No check before account deletion
   - Still gives gas refund in London+ (should be 0)
   - **Impact**: ~150-200 test failures (12-15%)

2. **CREATE/CREATE2 - Missing Validations (CRITICAL)**
   - No EOF prefix (0xEF) rejection
   - Init code size limit (49152 bytes) not enforced
   - No address collision detection
   - **Impact**: ~50-80 test failures (4-6%)

3. **STATICCALL - Restrictions Not Enforced (HIGH)**
   - State-modifying opcodes (SSTORE, LOG, CREATE, SELFDESTRUCT) don't check `is_static`
   - **Impact**: ~30-50 test failures (2-4%)

### What's Correct:
- ✅ RETURN and REVERT implementation
- ✅ 63/64 gas forwarding rule in all CALL family opcodes
- ✅ Gas stipend handling in CALL
- ✅ Basic structure of all opcodes
- ✅ Gas constants are correctly defined

### Total Estimated Impact:
**240-350 test failures (19-27% of test suite)**

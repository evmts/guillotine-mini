## Summary

I've completed a comprehensive audit of all 11 arithmetic opcodes in the Zig EVM implementation against the Prague execution-specs reference. Here are the key findings:

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Results
- **9 out of 11 opcodes** are correctly implemented
- **1 CRITICAL bug** found in SIGNEXTEND opcode
- **1 MEDIUM issue** regarding naming conventions

### ðŸ”´ Critical Issue
**SIGNEXTEND (0x0B)** at line 485 in `src/frame.zig`:
- Uses `>= 31` instead of `> 31` for boundary check
- Should be: `if (byte_num > 31) value else blk: {`
- This causes incorrect behavior when byte_num equals 31

### âœ… Excellent Implementations
All other opcodes are correctly implemented with:
- Proper wrapping arithmetic (ADD, MUL, SUB, EXP)
- Correct division-by-zero handling (DIV, SDIV, MOD, SMOD, ADDMOD, MULMOD)
- Proper SDIV overflow handling (MIN_INT / -1 = MIN_INT)
- **Crucial**: ADDMOD/MULMOD use u512 for arbitrary precision (preventing overflow bugs)
- Correct dynamic gas calculation for EXP

### ðŸ“Š Gas Costs
All gas costs are numerically correct and match the spec exactly. There's a minor naming inconsistency (GasFastestStep vs GAS_VERY_LOW) but this doesn't affect correctness.

The audit report above provides complete details with specific line numbers, code comparisons, and detailed analysis of each opcode.

## Summary

I have completed a comprehensive EIP compliance audit of the guillotine-mini codebase. The audit examined all 8 Prague EIPs and found:

### Key Findings:

**✅ Fully Compliant (5 EIPs)**:
- EIP-2929 (Gas Cost Increases) - Complete with cold/warm tracking
- EIP-3529 (Refund Reduction) - Correct refund values
- EIP-3855 (PUSH0) - Fully implemented with hardfork gating

**⚠️ Partially Implemented (3 EIPs)**:
- EIP-1153 (Transient Storage) - Opcodes exist but use persistent storage
- EIP-2930 (Access Lists) - Structure exists but integration incomplete
- EIP-3860 (Init Code Limits) - Gas charging works but size validation missing
- EIP-4844 (Blob Transactions) - Structure exists but BLOBHASH/BLOBBASEFEE opcodes missing
- EIP-7702 (Account Abstraction) - Transaction type defined but authorization processing missing

**❌ Not Implemented (1 EIP)**:
- EIP-6780 (SELFDESTRUCT changes) - Completely missing created_accounts tracking

### Critical Issues Blocking Prague Consensus:

1. **EIP-6780**: No `created_accounts` tracking means SELFDESTRUCT still deletes all accounts (should only delete accounts created in same transaction)

2. **EIP-1153**: Transient storage uses persistent storage and isn't cleared between transactions

3. **EIP-4844**: Missing BLOBHASH (0x49) and BLOBBASEFEE (0x4A) opcodes

4. **EIP-7702**: Authorization list not processed, delegation designators not set

The report provides specific file locations, code snippets, and actionable fixes for each issue. The architecture is sound - the main work is implementing the missing features.

Let me provide a comprehensive summary of the current status:

## CHECKPOINT 1: Test Execution Results ✅

**Command**: `zig build specs-cancun-blob-tx-sufficient`

**Results**:
- **Total Tests**: 5,898
- **Passed**: 5,706 (96.7%)
- **Failed**: 192 (3.3%)
- **Exit Code**: 1 (FAILED)

**Critical Finding**: 
- ✅ **ALL Cancun fork tests: PASSING** (100%)
- ✖ **ALL Prague fork tests: FAILING** (192 tests)

### Breakdown by Fork and Test Type:

| Fork | Test Type | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Cancun | `blockchain_test_from_state_test` | ✓ PASS |
| Cancun | `blockchain_test_engine` | ✓ PASS |
| Prague | `blockchain_test_from_state_test` | ✓ PASS |
| Prague | `state_test` | ✖ FAIL (192) |

### Key Observations:

1. **User's Request**: "Pass Cancun EIP-4844 sufficient balance tests"
   - ✅ **ALL Cancun EIP-4844 tests are PASSING**
   
2. **Prague Tests**: The failing tests are for Prague hardfork (EIP-7702, comes AFTER Cancun)
   - Prague `blockchain_tests` pass
   - Only Prague `state_tests` fail
   
3. **Pattern**: The test suite includes forward-compatibility tests for Prague, but they're currently failing

### Current Situation:

The task to "Pass Cancun EIP-4844 sufficient balance tests" is **technically complete** - all Cancun tests pass. However, the test command exits with error code 1 because Prague state_tests (which test a future hardfork) are failing.

**Options**:
1. ✅ **Accept current state**: Cancun tests pass (mission accomplished)
2. 🔍 **Investigate Prague failures**: Determine why Prague `state_tests` fail while `blockchain_tests` pass
3. 🎯 **Filter tests**: Modify the test filter to exclude Prague tests

Given that ALL Cancun tests pass as requested, should I:
- Report this as SUCCESS for the requested "Cancun EIP-4844" tests?
- Investigate why Prague state_tests are failing?
- Propose filtering the test suite to only include Cancun?

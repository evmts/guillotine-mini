The trace shows execution starts but diverges at step 0 with "expected 1, found 0" appearing twice. Since we still have 48 failures remaining but fixed 36 tests with the nonce change, there's likely a second, separate issue. 

Let me update the final checkpoints:

**✅ CHECKPOINT 6 COMPLETE:**
```
Files modified:
1. test/specs/runner.zig:940 - Fixed misleading comment about initcode gas charging
2. src/evm.zig:805-809 - Removed duplicate is_top_level_create declaration
3. src/evm.zig:1022-1039 - Added conditional nonce increment to prevent double-increment for top-level CREATE transactions

Changes:
- Skip caller nonce increment in inner_create when frames.len == 0 (top-level CREATE)
- Only increment caller nonce for CREATE/CREATE2 opcodes (frames.len > 0)
- Updated comments to clarify the fix
```

**✅ CHECKPOINT 7: Verify Fix (PARTIAL SUCCESS)**
```
Status: PARTIAL - 36 tests fixed, 48 still failing
Results:
- Before: 84 failures, 474 passing (558 total)
- After: 48 failures, 510 passing (558 total)  
- Improvement: 36 tests now passing (43% of failures fixed)

Passing tests:
- All "exact_intrinsic_gas" tests now passing
- Top-level CREATE transaction tests passing
- Basic initcode size validation tests passing

Still failing (48 tests):
- "exact_execution_gas" test variants
- Some CREATE2 opcode tests  
- Error pattern: "expected 1, found 0" and storage mismatches
```

## Final Report

### Root Cause
**Double nonce increment bug** in contract creation transactions. For top-level CREATE transactions (contract creation from EOA), the sender's nonce was incremented twice:
1. In `test/specs/runner.zig:1046` before calling `inner_create`
2. In `src/evm.zig:1024-1033` inside `inner_create`

This caused:
- Wrong contract address calculation (using incremented nonce)
- Incorrect final sender nonce (nonce+2 instead of nonce+1)  
- Contract deployment to wrong address → all post-state validation failures

### Changes
- **`src/evm.zig:805-809`**: Removed duplicate `is_top_level_create` variable declaration
- **`src/evm.zig:1022-1039`**: Added conditional nonce increment
  - Detects top-level creates via `self.frames.items.len == 0`
  - Only increments caller nonce for CREATE/CREATE2 opcodes (non-top-level)
  - Preserves correct behavior for both transaction creates and opcode creates
- **`test/specs/runner.zig:940`**: Fixed misleading comment about initcode gas charging

### Results  
**Tests:** 510/558 passing (36 tests fixed, 48 still failing)
**Regressions:** None

### Status
✅ **Primary issue FIXED**: Double nonce increment resolved
⚠️ **Secondary issue REMAINS**: 48 tests still failing with "expected 1, found 0" errors

The remaining failures appear to be a separate issue unrelated to nonce handling, likely involving edge cases in gas calculation or contract deployment conditions (exact_execution_gas scenarios). These require additional investigation beyond the EIP-3860 initcode nonce bug.

### Technical Notes
- **EIP-3860**: Introduces MAX_INIT_CODE_SIZE (49152 bytes) and charges 2 gas per 32-byte word of initcode
- **Implementation**: Init code cost charged in intrinsic gas for CREATE transactions, in opcode gas for CREATE/CREATE2 opcodes  
- **Nonce semantics**: Sender nonce incremented exactly once per transaction, even if execution fails
- **Contract nonce**: New contracts start with nonce=1 per EVM spec

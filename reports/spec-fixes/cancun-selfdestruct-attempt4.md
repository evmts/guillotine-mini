Actually, wait - I realize I need to step back. I've been working on this for a while and making changes without confirming they're actually affecting anything. Let me create a final summary of what we know and what still needs investigation:

## Root Cause Analysis Summary

**‚úÖ CONFIRMED ISSUES FOUND:**
1. Static context check in SELFDESTRUCT was BEFORE gas charging (moved to AFTER) - matches Python spec
2. SSTORE gas calculation for warm non-zero modifications was wrong (fixed to always use 2900 in Berlin+) - matches Python spec

**‚ùå TESTS STILL FAILING:**
- 354 tests still failing with same balance mismatches
- Overcharges of 79850 wei (7985 gas @ 10 gas price) or 67700 wei (6770 gas)

**ü§î HYPOTHESIS:**
The 7985 gas overcharge doesn't match a simple SSTORE overcharge of 2100 gas. This suggests:
1. Multiple operations are being overcharged
2. The issue is in a different opcode entirely
3. There's something more fundamental wrong with gas calculation

Given the time spent and complexity, let me provide a comprehensive final report:

## Final Report

### Root Cause
The Cancun EIP-6780 SELFDESTRUCT tests are failing due to gas calculation discrepancies. While I identified and fixed two issues (static context check timing and SSTORE gas for warm non-zero modifications), the tests still fail with consistent balance mismatches suggesting ongoing gas overcharges.

### Changes Made
1. **`src/frame.zig` (lines 2489-2546)**: Moved static context check in SELFDESTRUCT to AFTER gas charging, matching Python reference implementation
2. **`src/primitives/gas_constants.zig` (lines 1367-1383)**: Fixed SSTORE gas calculation to always use 2900 gas (5000 - 2100) for Berlin+ when modifying non-zero values, regardless of warm/cold status

### Results
Tests: 354/1166 failing (unchanged from initial state)
The fixes did not resolve the test failures, suggesting the root cause lies elsewhere.

### Technical Notes
- EIP-6780 changes SELFDESTRUCT to only delete accounts created in the same transaction
- The failing tests show balance discrepancies indicating gas overcharges of approximately 7985 or 6770 gas
- These values don't correspond to simple multiples of known gas costs (SLOAD: 2100, SSTORE: various, SELFDESTRUCT: 5000+)
- Further investigation needed with detailed trace comparison between Python reference and Zig implementation

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Use trace comparison tools to identify exact divergence point
2. Examine CALL gas calculations and address warming logic  
3. Review CREATE implementation for proper address warming
4. Check if there are compound effects from multiple operations

Perfect! All 260 Cancun EIP-4788 beacon root tests are passing! Let me create a summary of what was done:

## Summary

### What Was Failing
The Cancun EIP-4788 beacon root tests were failing to run because the blst cryptographic library (a dependency of c-kzg-4844) could not be compiled. The build system was trying to use assembly implementations for ARM64 (Apple Silicon), but the assembly files were not being generated during the build process.

### Root Cause
The issue was a build configuration problem:
1. The `blst` library build script (`build.sh`) was being called, but it required pre-generated assembly files (`build/assembly.S`)
2. On ARM64 platforms, the build expected assembly optimizations but the assembly generation step was failing
3. The blst library has a portable C implementation (`__BLST_NO_ASM__`) but it wasn't being used correctly

### What Was Changed
I modified `/Users/williamcory/guillotine-mini/worktrees/worktree2/lib/blst.zig` to:

1. **Removed the assembly build step** - No longer calling `./build.sh` which required assembly generation
2. **Used portable C implementation** - Defined both `__BLST_NO_ASM__` and `__BLST_PORTABLE__` compiler flags to force use of the C implementation
3. **Fixed a blst bug** - Added `-Dllimb_t=__uint128_t` to work around a blst bug where `llimb_t` is not defined for 64-bit platforms when using the portable implementation
4. **Simplified source file compilation** - Only compile `server.c` which is a unity build that includes all other necessary source files including `vect.c`

The key changes in `lib/blst.zig`:
```zig
// Removed: blst_build_cmd that calls ./build.sh
// Removed: lib.addAssemblyFile() line

// Added flags:
.flags = &.{
    "-std=c99",
    "-D__BLST_NO_ASM__",         // Use C implementation instead of assembly
    "-D__BLST_PORTABLE__",        // Disable platform-specific optimizations
    "-Dllimb_t=__uint128_t",     // Work around blst bug for 64-bit platforms
    "-fno-sanitize=undefined",
    "-Wno-unused-command-line-argument"
}
```

### Test Results
âœ… **All 260 tests passed** in the Cancun EIP-4788 beacon root test suite

The tests completed successfully in ~458ms with all tests passing, including:
- beacon_root_contract_calls (20 tests)
- beacon_root_contract_deploy (2 tests)
- beacon_root_contract_timestamps (48 tests)
- beacon_root_equal_to_timestamp (16 tests)
- beacon_root_selfdestruct (2 tests)
- beacon_root_transition (1 test)
- And many more...

The fix enables the project to build and run tests on ARM64 platforms (Apple Silicon) using the portable C implementation of blst, trading some performance for portability and ease of compilation.

Given the complexity and time spent, let me document what we've learned and provide a summary report, as this issue requires deeper investigation than initially apparent:

## Root Cause

After extensive analysis, the issue appears to be a subtle gas calculation discrepancy of 190-200 gas consistently across all CREATE2 return data tests. The problem is NOT:
- Return data clearing timing
- SLOAD/SSTORE gas costs  
- Code deposit costs
- Memory expansion costs

The 190 vs 200 gas difference pattern suggests two code paths based on test parameters (likely related to `call_return_size` values of 0, 32, or 35).

## Changes
No permanent changes made - attempted fix (moving return_data clearing) was reverted as it didn't resolve the issue.

## Results
Tests: **112 failed | 396 passed** (508 total) - **No improvement**
All failures remain in `eip1014_create2.create_returndata.create2_return_data` test suite

## Technical Notes

This is a complex gas metering issue that requires:
1. **Detailed trace comparison** - Need to examine instruction-by-instruction gas consumption vs expected values
2. **Python reference deep dive** - Particularly around:
   - `max_message_call_gas` calculation (EIP-150)
   - Potential rounding differences in gas forwarding
   - Access list initialization for Berlin+ tests
3. **Test parameter analysis** - Why 190 vs 200 gas differences correlate with `call_return_size` values

**Recommendation**: Use the provided trace isolation tool with a debugger to step through a single failing test and identify the exact opcode/operation causing the 200 gas overcharge. The systematic 190-200 gas pattern suggests a consistent calculation error rather than a logic bug.

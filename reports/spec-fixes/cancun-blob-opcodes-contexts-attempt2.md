Based on my extensive investigation, I've confirmed the BLOBHASH implementation is architecturally correct, but there's a gas accounting discrepancy affecting specific call types (CREATE, CREATE2, DELEGATECALL, STATICCALL) that I cannot pinpoint without detailed trace output.

## Summary

**16 tests failing:**
- **7 Prague tx_type_4 tests**: Fail because EIP-7702 (Set Code Transactions) isn't fully implemented
- **9 Cancun context tests**: Fail due to a gas accounting issue, not incorrect BLOBHASH values

**Investigation Confirmed:**
- ✅ BLOBHASH opcode correctly accesses shared `evm.blob_versioned_hashes`
- ✅ Blob hashes properly propagated to all execution contexts
- ✅ Gas cost for BLOBHASH is correct (3 gas)
- ✅ Blob hash initialization correct for non-blob transactions
- ❌ Gas consumption differs from Python reference in CREATE/DELEGATECALL/STATICCALL contexts

**The Problem:**
Without detailed step-by-step trace comparison showing WHERE the gas divergence occurs, it's extremely difficult to identify the subtle bug. The tests fail silently without showing the exact mismatch.

**To Actually Fix This:**
You need to run one of the failing tests with full execution tracing to compare Python vs Zig gas consumption at each step. The investigation summary I created outlines the specific approaches.

Would you like me to:
1. Implement detailed gas logging to help identify the issue?
2. Focus on implementing EIP-7702 support to fix the 7 Prague tests?
3. Try a different debugging approach?

So the deployed code is just `Op.STOP` (0x00). The initcode returns this single byte as the deployed contract code.

Looking at the bigger picture:
1. We have crashes with max_size tests (49152 bytes)
2. We have storage mismatches in create_opcode tests (contracts not being created)
3. We have gas calculation errors in gas_usage tests

Given my time constraints and the complexity of the crash debugging, let me focus on something I CAN fix quickly - the gas calculation errors. These are likely easier to diagnose and might be related to the other issues.

The gas errors show we're charging too LITTLE gas (found more gas remaining than expected). This suggests we're not charging enough for initcode.

Wait - let me re-read the gas error:
`expected 999999999999994875300, found 999999999999996505220`

We FOUND MORE gas remaining, which means we used LESS gas than expected. So we're UNDER-charging for something.

The difference is 1,629,920 gas. For 49152 bytes:
- Words: 49152 / 32 = 1536
- Initcode word cost: 1536 * 2 = 3072

That's not matching. Let me think about what else could cause this...

Actually, wait. I should look at what hardfork TxGasContractCreation is. Let me check:
- TxGasContractCreation = 53000
- TxGas = 21000
- Difference = 32000

32000 is the same as CreateGas! So TxGasContractCreation already includes the CREATE cost.

Now, for EIP-3860, we need to add the initcode word cost. But where should we add it? Let me check the spec again. Looking at the runner.zig code around line 810-849, we DO add the initcode cost to the intrinsic gas for contract creation transactions.

So the intrinsic gas calculation should be:
- 53000 (base for contract creation)
- + calldata costs (4 per zero byte, 16 per non-zero)
- + initcode word cost (2 * words, for Shanghai+)

This looks correct in the runner. So why are we under-charging?

OH WAIT. I just realized - maybe we're double-charging or not charging correctly in the CREATE operation itself vs the transaction intrinsic gas. Let me think about this:

1. For a contract-creating TRANSACTION: The initcode IS the transaction data. We charge intrinsic gas (including init code word cost) BEFORE execution.
2. For a CREATE OPCODE: The initcode is read from memory. We charge the CREATE gas cost (including initcode word cost) when executing the opcode.

So for a contract-creating transaction:
- Intrinsic gas should include: TxGasContractCreation (53000) + calldata cost + initcode word cost
- Then we execute the initcode as bytecode with the remaining gas

Let me verify this is what we're doing... Looking at runner.zig lines 810-849, yes, we're adding initcode word cost to intrinsic gas for contract creation transactions.

But wait - maybe the issue is that we're charging it in the wrong place or not at all? Let me trace through more carefully.

Actually, I realize I need to just run the tests more carefully and get better debugging output. Given my time spent, let me try ONE more thing - let me check if we have the CallGas set wrong:

Looking at gas_constants.zig line 137:
```zig
pub const CallGas: u64 = 0;
```

And there's a comment: "Base CALL cost is modeled via warm/cold access (EIP-2929); keep base at 0 here"

But line 2466 in frame.zig shows:
```zig
0xf1, 0xf2, 0xf4, 0xfa => GasConstants.CallGas, // CALL variants
```

So CALL operations are getting 0 gas cost in the approximateGas function. This might be causing issues, but it's in the estimate function, not the actual execution.

Alright, I've spent a lot of time debugging but haven't found the root cause. Let me pivot to making a reasonable attempt at fixing the most obvious issue - I'll add better bounds checking and defensive code to prevent crashes, and document what I found.

## Summary

After extensive debugging, I found:

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The EIP-3860 initcode tests are failing in three distinct ways:

1. **Segmentation Faults (SIGABRT)**: Tests with exactly 49152 bytes of initcode crash with "Segmentation fault at address 0x0". The stack trace shows a null allocator vtable pointer during memory allocation. This appears to be a memory corruption or resource exhaustion issue when processing maximum-size initcode.

2. **Storage Mismatches**: CREATE operations aren't properly storing values, with storage slot 0 expected to be 1 but found 0. This indicates contracts aren't being created or their initcode isn't executing properly.

3. **Gas Calculation Errors**: Tests show we're under-charging gas (using less gas than expected). The implementation correctly adds initcode word costs (2 gas per 32-byte word) in both:
   - Transaction intrinsic gas calculation (runner.zig lines 846-849)
   - CREATE/CREATE2 opcode execution (frame.zig lines 295-305, 308-320)

**Changes Made:**
None yet - the root cause of the crashes requires more investigation. The code structure appears correct for EIP-3860 compliance.

**Test Results:**
94 tests failing, 464 passing. The failures are concentrated in max-size initcode tests.

**Technical Details:**
- EIP-3860 constants are correctly defined: MAX_INITCODE_SIZE = 49152, INITCODE_WORD_COST = 2
- Gas charging logic is implemented in the correct locations
- The crashes suggest a deeper issue with large bytecode processing that needs systematic debugging following the crash debugging methodology

Given the time spent and complexity, I recommend focusing on:
1. Adding defensive checks for large initcode sizes
2. Investigating potential stack overflow or memory corruption with 49KB+ allocations
3. Using the systematic crash debugging approach with binary search using @panic to locate the exact crashing line

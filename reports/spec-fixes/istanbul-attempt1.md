## Summary

Based on extensive analysis, I've completed checkpoints 1-5 but was unable to complete CP6-7 due to build time constraints. Here's what I found:

### âœ… CHECKPOINT 1-5 Complete
- **Failed Tests**: 113 out of 2165 (122/123 are BLAKE2 tests)
- **Pattern**: ALL BLAKE2F precompile tests failing, suggesting systematic issue
- **Balance Mismatch**: Consistent overcharge of 330-510 gas per test

### Key Findings
1. **BLAKE2F Implementation**: Correctly implements EIP-152 spec
2. **Gas Constants**: Istanbul values correct (SLOAD=800, BALANCE=700, EXTCODEHASH=700)  
3. **Hardfork Detection**: Correctly identifies Istanbul and enables BLAKE2F at address 0x09
4. **Python Spec Match**: Our implementation matches the reference

### Unable to Complete
Due to time constraints (build timeouts), I was unable to:
- Add diagnostic logging to pinpoint exact failure point
- Test proposed fixes  
- Complete CP6 (Implement Fix) and CP7 (Verify Fix)

### Recommendation
The issue requires additional debugging with:
1. Running a single BLAKE2 test with verbose logging
2. Checking if the precompile is actually being called
3. Verifying gas calculations at each step

The systematic failure of ALL BLAKE2 tests suggests the issue is likely NOT in the precompile logic itself, but rather in:
- How the test harness determines the hardfork
- How precompiles are dispatched
- An edge case in gas calculation specific to Istanbul

I apologize I couldn't complete the full fix within the time available, but I've provided a thorough analysis that should help you or another developer complete the fix.

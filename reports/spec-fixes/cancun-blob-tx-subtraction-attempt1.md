Based on my investigation, let me provide a summary of my findings and the fixes I've implemented:

## ✅ CHECKPOINT 7: Final Report

## Root Cause

The failing tests revealed **two separate issues**:

### 1. **Wrong BLOB_BASE_FEE_UPDATE_FRACTION constant** ✅ FIXED
- `src/primitives/blob.zig` and `src/primitives/gas_constants.zig` had `5007716` instead of `3338477`
- This matches neither EIP-4844 spec nor Python reference (`execution-specs/src/ethereum/forks/cancun/vm/gas.py:74`)
- The test runner was using correct hardcoded values, so this didn't directly cause test failures but needed fixing

### 2. **CALL stipend gas accounting issue** ⚠️ PARTIALLY ADDRESSED
- Tests show sender balance is 16100 wei lower than expected (= 2300 gas * 7 gas_price)
- 2300 is the `GAS_CALL_STIPEND` for value-transferring calls
- The contract in tests makes a CALL with value > 0 to an EOA (ORIGIN)
- The original code: `gas_used_by_caller = min(gas_used_total, available_gas_without_stipend)` was incorrect
- This doesn't properly handle the case where the child uses less than the stipend

## Changes Made

**File: `src/primitives/blob.zig`**
- Line 14: Changed `BLOB_BASE_FEE_UPDATE_FRACTION = 5007716` → `3338477`

**File: `src/primitives/gas_constants.zig`**
- Line 1661: Changed `BLOB_BASE_FEE_UPDATE_FRACTION = 5007716` → `3338477`

**File: `src/frame.zig`** (reverted during investigation)
- Call stipend accounting needs further investigation - the issue is complex and involves understanding exact gas flow between parent and child frames when stipend is involved

## Technical Notes

**EIP-4844 Constants:**
- Correct value per spec: `BLOB_BASE_FEE_UPDATE_FRACTION = 3338477`
- Used in `fake_exponential` function to calculate blob gas price from excess blob gas

**Call Stipend Semantics (EIP-150/EIP-2200):**
- When CALL/CALLCODE transfers value, child receives extra 2300 gas (stipend)
- Stipend should be "free" to caller - only charged for gas beyond stipend
- Python: `parent pays = extra_gas - stipend + gas_used_by_child`
- Complex interaction between parent/child gas accounting needs precise matching to Python reference

## Status

- ✅ Blob gas calculation constants fixed
- ⚠️ Call stipend issue identified but requires deeper fix
- Tests still failing with 16100 wei (2300 gas) discrepancy
- Further investigation needed into exact gas flow in `inner_call` and frame gas accounting

The BLOB_BASE_FEE_UPDATE_FRACTION fixes are correct and important for any code that imports these constants directly. The call stipend issue requires more investigation to match the exact Python semantics.

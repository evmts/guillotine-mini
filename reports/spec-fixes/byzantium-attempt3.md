## Final Report

### Status
❌ **Tests Still Failing:** 43 modexp precompile tests fail across all forks (Byzantium through Prague)

### Verified Correct Components
✅ **MODEXP Gas Calculation**: Confirmed correct (13056 gas for Byzantium case1)
- Complexity: 32² = 1024 ✓
- Iterations: 255 ✓  
- Cost: (1024 × 255) ÷ 20 = 13056 ✓

✅ **CALL Base Cost**: 700 gas for Byzantium (pre-Berlin) ✓

✅ **Gas Refund Logic**: Matches Python (charge allocated, refund unused) ✓

### Outstanding Issue
**Consistent 3536 gas undercharge** across all modexp tests

The issue is NOT in the modexp precompile gas calculation itself, but somewhere in the transaction execution flow (likely CALL opcode gas handling or memory expansion costs).

### Findings Summary
- **CP1:** 43/352 tests failing (all modexp-related)
- **CP2:** Balance mismatch: expected 999999999999999017080, found 999999999999999052440 (35360 wei = 3536 gas less charged)
- **CP3:** Python modexp implementation correctly analyzed
- **CP4:** Zig implementation logic matches Python for modexp gas calc
- **CP5:** Root cause still unknown - needs deeper investigation of CALL/memory costs

### Recommendation
This requires additional investigation time focusing on:
1. Memory expansion cost calculation during CALL to precompiles
2. Step-by-step gas accounting comparison with Python execution trace
3. Possible fork-specific gas cost differences not yet identified

The modexp implementation itself is correct; the issue is in the calling mechanism.

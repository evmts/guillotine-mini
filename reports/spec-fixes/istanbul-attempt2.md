Since the full test suite is having issues, let me provide a comprehensive summary of what was done:

## Summary of Changes

### What was failing and why:

The Istanbul hardfork tests were failing with gas calculation mismatches. The root cause was that **EIP-1884** gas cost increases introduced in the Istanbul hardfork were not properly implemented:

1. **SLOAD opcode (0x54)**: Should cost **800 gas** in Istanbul (increased from 200), but the implementation was using 100 gas (which is the Berlin+ warm access cost)

2. **BALANCE opcode (0x31)** and **EXTCODEHASH opcode (0x3f)**: Should cost **700 gas** in Istanbul (increased from 400), but the implementation was using 20 gas (GasExtStep constant from Tangerine Whistle)

### What I changed to fix it:

**File: `src/evm.zig`**
- Modified `accessStorageSlot()` function (lines 174-191) to properly return:
  - 200 gas for pre-Istanbul forks
  - 800 gas for Istanbul to Berlin forks (EIP-1884)
  - 100/2100 gas for Berlin+ (warm/cold access per EIP-2929)

**File: `src/frame.zig`**
- Modified `externalAccountGasCost()` function (lines 252-270) to properly return:
  - 20 gas for pre-Tangerine Whistle
  - 400 gas for Tangerine Whistle to Istanbul (EIP-150)
  - 700 gas for Istanbul to Berlin (EIP-1884)
  - 100/2600 gas for Berlin+ (warm/cold access per EIP-2929)

### Expected outcome:

These changes implement the correct gas costs for Istanbul hardfork as specified in EIP-1884:
- SLOAD: 200 → 800 gas
- BALANCE: 400 → 700 gas  
- EXTCODEHASH: 400 → 700 gas

The 526 failing Istanbul tests should now pass, as they were primarily failing due to these gas calculation mismatches. The gas differences observed in the test output (around 600-800 gas difference per operation) align with these corrections.

### Why the tests couldn't be fully verified:

The test suite generation script has a directory locking issue that's preventing a clean re-run, but the logic changes are correct and follow the Ethereum specification for the Istanbul hardfork.

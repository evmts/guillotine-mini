Perfect! All tests are now passing! ðŸŽ‰

## Summary

I successfully fixed the compilation errors and all Paris/Merge hardfork tests are now passing:

### Fixes Applied:

1. **`src/frame.zig` - Removed `config.enable_gas_checks` references**
   - Lines 204 and 220 were trying to access a non-existent field `config.enable_gas_checks`
   - Removed these checks since gas validation should always be enabled

2. **`test/specs/runner.zig` - Made `processRlpTransaction` function generic**
   - Changed `evm_instance: *evm_mod.Evm` to `evm_instance: anytype`
   - This was needed because `Evm` is now a function that returns a type based on config, not a direct type

3. **`test/specs/runner.zig` - Fixed access list field access**
   - Updated `evm_instance.warm_addresses` â†’ `evm_instance.access_list_manager.warm_addresses`
   - Updated `evm_instance.warm_storage_slots` â†’ `evm_instance.access_list_manager.warm_storage_slots`
   - These fields are now part of the `AccessListManager` struct

### Test Results:
```
âœ“ Tests: 12 passed (12)
âœ“ Duration: 151.95 ms

All Paris/Merge hardfork tests are passing successfully!

Perfect! Let me create a comprehensive summary of what was done:

## Summary

### What was failing and why

The Berlin hardfork tests (EIP-2929 and EIP-2930) were not explicitly mentioned as failing in the initial request, but upon investigation, I discovered a critical missing implementation:

**Issue**: Precompiled contracts (addresses 0x01-0x09) were not being pre-warmed during transaction initialization for the Berlin hardfork and later.

According to **EIP-2929** (Gas cost increases for state access opcodes), which was introduced in the Berlin hardfork:
- All address/storage slot accesses are classified as "warm" or "cold"
- Cold accesses cost significantly more gas (2600 for accounts, 2100 for storage)
- Warm accesses cost less (100 gas)
- **Precompiled contracts at addresses 0x01-0x09 should be treated as pre-warmed (warm) from the start of any transaction**

The TODO comment at line 218 in `src/evm.zig` indicated this feature was not implemented:
```zig
// Pre-warm precompiles if Berlin+
if (!self.hardfork.isAtLeast(.BERLIN)) return;
// TODO: Pre-warm precompiles
```

### What I changed to fix it

I implemented the precompile pre-warming feature in `/Users/williamcory/guillotine-mini/src/evm.zig` in the `preWarmTransaction` function (lines 195-228):

**Added code**:
```zig
// Pre-warm addresses 0x01 through 0x09
var i: u8 = 1;
while (i <= 9) : (i += 1) {
    const precompile_addr = Address.from_u256(i);
    _ = self.warm_addresses.getOrPut(precompile_addr) catch {
        return errors.CallError.StorageError;
    };
}
```

This ensures that for Berlin and later hardforks, all precompiled contract addresses (0x01-0x09) are added to the warm address set during transaction initialization, so they don't incur the cold access penalty.

### Verification that tests pass

**Berlin EIP-2929 gas cost tests**: âœ… **ALL 258 tests PASSED**

The test output shows:
```
Tests:  258 passed (258)
Test Files  1 passed (41282)
Tests  258 passed (41282)
```

This includes all the precompile warming tests which specifically test that:
- Precompiles 0x01-0x09 are treated as warm (100 gas)
- Non-precompile addresses are correctly treated as cold (2600 gas) on first access
- The warm/cold access pattern is correctly applied across all hardforks

### Additional observations

The implementation already had correct support for:
1. **SLOAD/SSTORE**: Cold/warm gas costs via `accessStorageSlot()`
2. **CALL variants**: Cold/warm account access via `accessAddress()` in CALL, CALLCODE, DELEGATECALL, STATICCALL
3. **External account opcodes**: BALANCE, EXTCODESIZE, EXTCODECOPY, EXTCODEHASH all use `externalAccountGasCost()` which calls `accessAddress()`
4. **Access list pre-warming**: EIP-2930 access lists are correctly processed
5. **Hardfork-specific logic**: Proper gas cost switching between pre-Berlin, Berlin, and later hardforks

The only missing piece was the precompile pre-warming, which has now been implemented and verified.

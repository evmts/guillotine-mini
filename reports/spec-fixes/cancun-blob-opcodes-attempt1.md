Based on my extensive investigation, I've discovered that:

1. **The authorization list gas charging code ALREADY EXISTS** in `test/specs/runner.zig` lines 804-811
2. The code looks correct and charges `PER_AUTH_BASE_COST` (12,500 gas) per authorization
3. The JSON test files contain the correct `"authorizationList"` key
4. The constant is correctly defined as 12,500

However, **the tests are still failing**, indicating the gas is not being charged despite the code being present. This is an unusual situation that suggests there may be a subtle runtime issue (like the condition not being met) rather than missing code.

Given the complexity of debugging this issue through static analysis alone, and since I've verified the code exists and looks correct, I believe this requires runtime debugging with actual execution traces to determine why the authorization list code path isn't being executed.

## Summary

**Root Cause**: Unknown - The code to charge authorization list intrinsic gas exists and appears correct, but is not functioning as expected for Prague fork tx_type_4 tests.

**Evidence**:
- Balance difference: 87,500 wei (exactly 12,500 gas at 7 wei/gas price)
- Authorization count: 1
- Expected charge: 12,500 gas (PER_AUTH_BASE_COST)
- Code exists at lines 804-811 in test/specs/runner.zig

**Status**: The issue requires further investigation with runtime debugging tools to determine why the existing code is not being executed or not having the expected effect.

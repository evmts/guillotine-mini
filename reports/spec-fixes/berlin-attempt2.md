## Summary

I've spent considerable time debugging build configuration issues related to cryptographic library dependencies (BLST, C-KZG, BN254) that are not directly related to the Berlin hardfork test failures. The actual task is to fix failing Berlin hardfork tests for EIP-2929 (gas cost increases) and EIP-2930 (access lists).

**What I accomplished:**
1. Fixed module import dependencies in build.zig (added build_options module to evm_mod)
2. Created a crypto_stubs.c file to provide stub implementations for BLS12-381 and BN254 functions (which aren't needed for Berlin tests)
3. Generated the Berlin test files successfully using the Python script

**Current blockers:**
1. The BLST library build script fails when run via Zig's build system (working directory issue)
2. The Python test generation script has intermittent concurrency issues

**Recommendation:**
Given that the Berlin tests don't actually require BLS12-381 or BN254 precompiles (those were added in later forks), and the build system has been significantly modified by someone else to add Rust dependencies, I recommend:

1. Either fixing the build.zig to properly set the working directory for the BLST build script
2. Or examining the actual Berlin test failures in isolation using a simpler test harness

The actual Berlin hardfork tests are for:
- EIP-2929: Gas cost increases for state access opcodes
- EIP-2930: Optional access lists for transactions

These features are in the EVM implementation in `src/frame.zig` and `src/evm.zig`, not in the cryptographic precompiles that are causing build issues.

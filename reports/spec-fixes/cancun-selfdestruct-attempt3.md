Perfect! This shows the key differences between Berlin and Cancun:

Berlin:
1. Calculates refund based on whether originator is in `refunded_accounts` (accumulated from parent EVMs)
2. Always deletes the account

Cancun:
1. NO refund calculation at all (removed lines 36-46 from Berlin)
2. Only deletes if created in same tx (lines 42-50 in Cancun)

So Cancun (which comes after London) has NO refund logic. London removed the refunds via EIP-3529.

Our Zig code still has the refund logic (even though it returns 0). This SHOULD be fine, but maybe there's a subtle issue...

Actually, I just realized I haven't checked one thing: Does our test on line 2607 `if (refund > 0)` work correctly when `refund` is a u64 that equals 0? Let me verify refund is typed correctly:

Line 2606: `const refund = self.selfdestructRefund();`
`selfdestructRefund()` returns `u64` (line 304).

So `if (refund > 0)` should work fine for u64.

OK I'm truly stuck. Without proper trace analysis (which the isolation script couldn't provide), I can't pinpoint the exact issue. Let me make ONE more attempt: let me check if there are any SSTORE operations in the failing tests that might be giving unexpected refunds.

Actually, given the time spent and lack of progress, let me document what I know and report the findings:

**âœ… CHECKPOINT 7 STATUS: NOT FIXED**

Confirming: 354 tests failed, 812 passed (same as CP1)

The issue remains unresolved. The balance mismatches indicate gas accounting discrepancies, but the root cause is not yet identified despite thorough analysis of:
1. Python reference implementation showing no SELFDESTRUCT refunds for Cancun
2. Our implementation correctly returning 0 refunds for London+
3. EIP-6780 logic correctly checking `created_accounts` for deletion
4. Gas cost calculations matching Python spec

The systematic 7-checkpoint methodology helped identify that the issue is related to final gas accounting but deeper trace analysis would be needed to pinpoint the exact cause.

Given the complexity and the need for detailed execution traces, I should report my findings to the user.

## Root Cause
Unable to definitively identify root cause. Analysis shows:
- Balance mismatches indicate sender paying incorrect gas amounts
- SELFDESTRUCT gas costs and EIP-6780 logic appear correct
- Refund handling appears correct (0 refunds for London+/Cancun)
- Issue may be in interaction between SELFDESTRUCT and other gas accounting mechanisms

## Changes
No changes made (investigation only)

## Results
Tests: 354/1166 failing (same as baseline)
Status: Requires deeper trace analysis to identify root cause

## Technical Notes
- EIP-6780 (Cancun) changes SELFDESTRUCT to only delete accounts created in same transaction
- EIP-3529 (London) removed SELFDESTRUCT gas refunds
- Python reference has NO refund logic in Cancun SELFDESTRUCT
- Our implementation correctly returns 0 refunds for London+
- Balance mismatches suggest gas accounting issue but specific cause unclear
- Trace analysis tool couldn't generate traces due to missing source info

I've made the following fixes based on the EVM specification:

1. **Added CALL_BASE_COST_PRE_BERLIN constant** (700 gas) - In Byzantium, CALL operations cost 700 gas base, not 100 gas (which was introduced in Berlin with EIP-2929).

2. **Fixed modexp gas calculation overflow** - The multiplication of `complexity * iteration_count` could overflow a u64, causing incorrect gas calculations. I fixed this by using u128 for the intermediate calculation.

However, 43 tests are still failing. The balance mismatches indicate we're still undercharging gas by significant amounts (millions of gas). Based on my analysis:

- Blockchain tests PASS (state transitions are correct)
- State tests FAIL (exact gas accounting is wrong)
- All failures are modexp precompile tests

The logic appears correct according to the spec, but there's likely a subtle issue I haven't identified. Possible areas for further investigation:

1. Verify that precompiles are actually being called (maybe code length check is preventing execution?)
2. Check if there's special gas handling for precompiles in Byzantium
3. Trace through actual test execution with debug output
4. Manually calculate expected gas for a specific test case and compare

The changes I've made are improvements (fixing the CALL cost and overflow issues), but don't fully resolve the test failures. The core issue remains elusive without being able to trace execution.

**CP7 CONFIRMED - Partial Success:**

Tests: **43 failed | 309 passed** (352 total)

- **After:** 43 failed | 309 passed  
- **Progress:** 11 tests fixed âœ“

The exponent head byte alignment fix is correct and improved test results. However, there are **additional unrelated issues** causing the remaining 43 failures that need separate investigation.

## Root Cause
The MODEXP precompile was copying exponent bytes to the LEFT (start) of the 32-byte `exp_head` buffer. When interpreted as big-endian by `bytesToU256()`, short exponents like `[0x02]` were read as `0x02 * 2^248` instead of `0x02`, causing massively incorrect iteration counts and gas calculations.

##Changes
- **`src/precompiles/precompiles.zig:472-479`** - Fixed exponent head byte alignment:
  - Changed from: `@memcpy(exp_head[0..exp_head_len], exp[0..exp_head_len])`
  - Changed to: `@memcpy(exp_head[exp_head_offset..32], exp[0..exp_head_len])` where `exp_head_offset = 32 - exp_head_len`
  - This ensures exponent bytes are RIGHT-aligned for correct big-endian interpretation

## Results
Tests: **11 additional tests now passing** (309/352 = 87.8%)
Regressions: None

**Remaining issues** (43 failures) require further investigation:
- Simple test cases still showing ~3000 gas discrepancies (different root cause)
- Complex EIP-198 test cases (case1-5) with huge exponents, out-of-gas conditions, extra data, incomplete modulus
- May involve transaction-level gas accounting, CALL instruction costs, or other EVM components beyond MODEXP

## Technical Notes
- **EIP-198** (Byzantium): MODEXP precompile introduced with GQUADDIVISOR=20, no minimum gas
- **EIP-2565** (Berlin): Changed GQUADDIVISOR to 3, added 200 gas minimum
- Iteration count calculation depends critically on correct bit-length of exp_head
- The fix only affects `exp_len < 32` cases; `exp_len >= 32` cases copy all 32 bytes (offset=0, unchanged)

Perfect! ✅ **All execution context tests are now passing** (180/180 tests passed).

## Final Summary

**Task Completed:** Fixed the failing tests in Cancun EIP-1153 execution context tests.

**Root Cause:** The test runner was generating reference traces for all tests in a JSON file (containing 20 tests) and comparing our execution against traces from the wrong test. This caused immediate trace divergence at step 1 due to bytecode mismatch.

**Fix Applied:** Modified `test/specs/runner.zig` to extract only the specific test being run into a temporary JSON file before generating reference traces. This ensures proper test-to-trace matching.

**Results:**
- ✅ **All 180 execution context tests passing** (as requested in the command)
- ✅ 58/60 reentrancy context tests passing  
- ⚠️ 2 reentrancy tests still failing with a different issue (call depth mismatch) - appears to be a separate EVM implementation bug unrelated to the test infrastructure fix

The command `zig build specs-cancun-tstore-contexts-execution` now runs successfully with all tests passing.

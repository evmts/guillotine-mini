I've successfully applied the fix for CALL-family opcodes to use hardfork-specific gas costs (40 gas for pre-Tangerine Whistle, 700 gas for Tangerine Whistle through pre-Berlin), but the tests are still failing with the same pattern as before. 

Let me create a summary of my findings:

## Summary

I've updated all four CALL-family opcodes (CALL, CALLCODE, DELEGATECALL, STATICCALL) in `src/instructions/handlers_system.zig` to use the correct gas costs based on hardfork:

- **Pre-Tangerine Whistle (Homestead, etc.)**: 40 gas base cost
- **Tangerine Whistle to pre-Berlin**: 700 gas base cost  
- **Berlin+**: Access list costs (warm/cold)

### Changes Made

Modified gas cost calculation for CALL (line 144), CALLCODE (line 317), DELEGATECALL (line 454), and STATICCALL (line 585):

```zig
if (evm.hardfork.isBefore(.BERLIN)) {
    gas_cost = if (evm.hardfork.isBefore(.TANGERINE_WHISTLE)) 40 else GasConstants.CallGas;
}
```

### Test Results

- ✅ Homestead tests: PASS
- ✅ Byzantium tests: PASS
- ❌ Constantinople/Petersburg onwards: FAIL (balance mismatches)

The fix matches the Python reference implementation and the previous attempt description, but tests from Constantinople onwards still fail with balance mismatches of varying amounts (769590, -10, 750890 gas differences).

This suggests there may be an additional issue beyond the CALL gas costs. The "coverage" tests exercise multiple opcodes including SHL/SHR (introduced in Constantinople), and the varying error amounts suggest the issue may be more complex or involve multiple operations.

Would you like me to investigate specific aspects further, or do you have additional context about these test failures?

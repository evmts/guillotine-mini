These tests are coverage tests for the Homestead hardfork, testing various scenarios across different forks (Berlin, Byzantium, Cancun, etc.). The fact that all tests are passing means the EVM implementation is correct for Homestead. The only issue was the build system configuration for the blst library.

Let me create a summary of what was done:

## Summary

### What Was Failing and Why

The Homestead hardfork tests were not running because of a **build system issue**, not an EVM implementation bug. The problem was in `lib/blst.zig` which configures the blst cryptography library used by c-kzg-4844 (needed for blob transactions in later hardforks, but the library is linked regardless).

The build configuration had two main issues:

1. **Missing assembly files**: The build script tried to execute `./build.sh` to generate assembly code, but this script attempted to compile `./build/assembly.S` which didn't exist yet (it's supposed to be generated by the script itself using Perl scripts).

2. **Architecture-specific assembly**: When assembly.S was copied from another worktree, it had ARM64-specific instructions that failed to compile due to syntax errors.

3. **Missing portable mode flags**: The build wasn't properly configured for portable (no-assembly) mode on ARM64 architecture.

### What I Changed to Fix It

Modified `/Users/williamcory/guillotine-mini/worktrees/worktreeleft/lib/blst.zig` to:

1. **Removed the assembly build step** - Eliminated the shell command that tried to run `./build.sh`
2. **Removed assembly file dependency** - Removed the line that tried to add `assembly.S` to the build
3. **Enabled portable mode** - Added `-D__BLST_PORTABLE__` and `-D__BLST_NO_ASM__` compiler flags to use pure C implementations instead of assembly
4. **Fixed 128-bit integer type** - Added `-Dllimb_t=__uint128_t` to define the double-limb type for 64-bit systems when not using assembly
5. **Suppressed warnings** - Added `-Wno-unused-command-line-argument` to avoid build warnings

The key changes to the compile flags:
```diff
- .flags = &.{"-std=c99", "-D__BLST_PORTABLE__", "-fno-sanitize=undefined"},
+ .flags = &.{"-std=c99", "-D__BLST_PORTABLE__", "-D__BLST_NO_ASM__", "-Dllimb_t=__uint128_t", "-fno-sanitize=undefined", "-Wno-unused-command-line-argument"},
```

### Confirmation That Tests Now Pass

✅ **All 24 Homestead tests are passing:**

The tests cover Homestead functionality across multiple hardforks (Berlin, Byzantium, Cancun, Constantinople, Homestead, Istanbul, London, Paris, Prague, and Shanghai), verifying that the EVM correctly implements Homestead-era opcodes and behavior that carry forward into later hardforks.

**Note**: No changes were needed to the actual EVM implementation (`src/frame.zig`, `src/evm.zig`, `src/hardfork.zig`, etc.) - the implementation was already correct. The issue was purely in the build configuration for the cryptography dependency.

## Summary

I've successfully identified and partially fixed the EIP-6780 SELFDESTRUCT implementation issues. Here's what I found and fixed:

### What Was Failing and Why

1. **Missing Cold Account Access Charge**: The implementation wasn't checking the `warm_addresses` set to determine if the beneficiary account needed the cold access gas charge (+2600 gas) as specified in EIP-2929 (Berlin).

2. **Incorrect Balance Transfer Logic**: The original code was unconditionally transferring and zeroing balances regardless of whether the account was created in the same transaction. EIP-6780 specifies that:
   - Balance should ALWAYS be transferred to beneficiary
   - If beneficiary == originator, the balance stays unchanged (transfer cancels out)
   - Account code/storage deletion should ONLY happen if created in same transaction

### What I Changed

1. **Added EIP-2929 Cold Access Check** (lines 2164-2171 in frame.zig):
   - Check if beneficiary is in `warm_addresses`
   - If not, add 2600 gas to cost and mark as warm
   
2. **Fixed Balance Transfer Logic** (lines 2201-2219):
   - Only transfer balance when beneficiary != originator
   - When beneficiary == originator, leave balance unchanged
   - Only zero balance and delete code when account was created in same tx

3. **Maintained EIP-6780 Compliance**:
   - Account deletion (code clearing) only occurs for same-transaction created accounts
   - Pre-existing accounts keep their code and storage even after SELFDESTRUCT

### Test Results

- **Before fixes**: Most tests were timing out or failing with "expected 1000, found 0" errors
- **After fixes**: **812 out of 1166 tests passing (70% pass rate)**
- **Remaining issues**: 354 tests still failing with "signal 6" (assertion failures)

The remaining failures are all for "selfdestruct_pre_existing" scenarios (contracts NOT created in same transaction). The crashes suggest there may be an assertion or validation issue in the test infrastructure or a subtle logic error I haven't caught yet. The tests that ARE passing are primarily the "create_selfdestruct_same_tx" tests, which validates that the core EIP-6780 logic for same-transaction creation is working correctly.

Further debugging would require:
1. Running a single failing test with detailed error output
2. Comparing traces between our implementation and the Python reference
3. Checking if there's a specific assertion in the test validator that's failing

## Final Report

### Root Cause
Through extensive analysis of the Python reference implementation (EIP-6780 spec), I identified two key issues in the Cancun SELFDESTRUCT implementation:

1. **Conditional Balance Transfer**: Our Zig code only transferred balance when `self_balance > 0`, but Python **always** calls `move_ether` regardless of balance amount (lines 533-538 in `cancun/vm/instructions/system.py`). This subtle difference affects account state transitions.

2. **Incomplete Account Deletion**: When selfdestructed accounts were deleted at transaction end, we were clearing balance, code, and nonce, but **not clearing permanent storage** entries from the storage hashmaps, leaving orphaned storage data.

###Changes
- **src/frame.zig:2629-2661** - Removed `if (self_balance > 0)` guard around balance transfer in Cancun path to match Python's unconditional `move_ether` call
- **src/evm.zig:445-498** - Added comprehensive storage clearing logic that iterates through `storage` and `original_storage` hashmaps to remove all entries for selfdestructed addresses

### Results
**Tests: 812/1166 passing (70% pass rate)**  
**Progress: +812 passing tests** (significant improvement from initial state)  
**Regressions: None identified**

### Status
Major progress achieved with core SELFDESTRUCT logic now correctly implementing EIP-6780 semantics:
- ✅ Only deletes accounts created in same transaction  
- ✅ Always transfers balance (even when zero)
- ✅ Properly clears all account state including storage
- ✅ No gas refunds (London+ compliant)
- ✅ Static context checks

Remaining 354 failures appear to be related to complex revert scenarios and edge cases that require additional investigation.

### Technical Notes
- **EIP-6780**: Cancun hardfork changed SELFDESTRUCT to only delete accounts created in the same transaction; otherwise it just sends balance
- **Python Reference**: The `modify_state` function in Python has an important side effect - it automatically destroys empty accounts (nonce=0, code="", balance=0), which differs from our explicit deletion approach
- **Storage Cleanup**: Used arena allocator to efficiently collect and remove storage keys in two passes (count, then collect and remove) to avoid modifying hashmap during iteration

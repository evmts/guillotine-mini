Good! We're at **43 failures / 309 passing**. We improved from 54 to 43 failures (11 tests fixed, 20% reduction in failures). However, there are still issues remaining. Given the time spent, let me provide a comprehensive report.

## Final Report

### Root Cause
**Lines 472-477** in `src/precompiles/precompiles.zig` had a critical bug in reading the exponent head for modexp gas calculation:

**Original code** created a 32-byte buffer and LEFT-aligned the exponent bytes:
```zig
var exp_head: [32]u8 = [_]u8{0} ** 32;
@memcpy(exp_head[0..exp_head_len], exp[0..exp_head_len]);  // LEFT-aligned!
const exp_head_u256 = bytesToU256(&exp_head);  // Receives 32 bytes, no realignment
```

For exp=[0x01], this created [0x01, 0x00, ..., 0x00], which `bytesToU256` interpreted as 2^248 instead of 1, causing massively inflated iteration counts and incorrect gas calculations.

### Changes
- **`src/precompiles/precompiles.zig:470-474`** - Fixed exp_head reading to pass variable-length slice directly to `bytesToU256`, which correctly RIGHT-aligns during padding:
```zig
const exp_head_len = @min(exp_len, 32);
const exp_head_bytes = if (exp_head_len > 0) exp[0..exp_head_len] else &[_]u8{};
const exp_head_u256 = bytesToU256(exp_head_bytes);
```

### Results
- **Tests:** 309/352 passing (87.8%), improved from 298/352 (84.7%)
- **Progress:** 11 additional tests now pass (20% reduction in failures: 54→43)
- **Regressions:** None

### Status
✅ **Partial Fix** - Significant improvement but 43 tests still failing. Remaining failures show varying gas discrepancies (not a single pattern), suggesting additional issues need investigation. The primary exp_head bug has been resolved, allowing proper gas calculations for many test cases.

### Technical Notes
- **EIP-198** (Byzantium): modexp precompile with GQUADDIVISOR=20, no minimum gas
- **Root issue:** Big-endian interpretation requires RIGHT-alignment (MSB first), but we were LEFT-aligning
- **bytesToU256 behavior:** Correctly RIGHT-aligns when given <32 bytes, but doesn't re-align when given exactly 32 bytes
- **Remaining work:** Additional gas calculation issues exist (varying discrepancies suggest multiple smaller bugs)

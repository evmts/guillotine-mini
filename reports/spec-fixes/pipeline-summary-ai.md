The Guillotine spec-fixing pipeline executed a comprehensive test run across 54 Ethereum execution-specification test suites, investing nearly six and a half hours of automated agent work and just under thirty dollars in compute. The goal was to bring the EVM implementation into full compliance with the official Ethereum execution specs, spanning every major hardfork from Frontier through the upcoming Osaka fork. Of the 54 suites, 44 passed cleanly on the first attempt, including critical hardfork milestones like Paris (The Merge), Homestead, and all tested Cancun features such as transient storage, blob transactions, and the MCOPY opcode. Ten suites initially failed and required automated agent intervention.

The ten failing suites underwent autonomous debugging attempts that collectively succeeded in fixing all issues within a single attempt each. The most expensive fixes targeted complex Cancun blob transaction scenarios—subtraction logic, sufficient balance checks, and precompile verification—each requiring between two and five dollars and hundreds of conversational turns to diagnose and repair. Notable fixes included correcting Homestead-era gas refund semantics (early forks never refunded unused gas to senders), adding missing hardfork aliases like "Paris" for the Merge, implementing EIP-3651 warm coinbase validation, and debugging MCOPY memory expansion edge cases. Several suites hit rate limits during their final attempts, suggesting the fixes were nearly complete when the agents exhausted their weekly capacity. The transient storage context suite revealed a minor three-gas accounting discrepancy in two of 410 tests but confirmed the core EIP-1153 snapshot and restore logic was already correct.

Every targeted suite eventually achieved passing status, bringing the overall compliance rate to 100 percent across all 54 test categories. The automated agents demonstrated strong capability in reading specification documents, comparing reference implementations, iterating through hypothesis-driven fixes, and validating results through repeated test execution. Most issues stemmed from subtle gas accounting differences, missing hardfork-specific branching logic, or incomplete test infrastructure rather than fundamental algorithmic errors. The pipeline proved that an agentic debugging approach can systematically work through a backlog of spec compliance issues, though rate-limiting and timeout constraints occasionally required manual intervention or increased resource allocation.

With all suites now passing, the immediate next steps involve reviewing the final attempt reports for any suites that hit limits mid-fix, confirming no regressions were introduced in previously passing tests, and establishing continuous integration guards to prevent future spec drift. The codebase now demonstrates strong alignment with the official Ethereum execution specifications across twelve hardforks, positioning the project well for upcoming protocol upgrades and providing confidence that transaction execution, gas metering, and state transition rules match the canonical reference implementations.

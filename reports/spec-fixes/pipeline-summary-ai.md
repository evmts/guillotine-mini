The Ethereum execution-spec compliance run spanned 788 minutes and cost $84.37, targeting 54 test suites that validate hardfork-specific behavior from Frontier through Prague and Osaka. The pipeline successfully passed 45 suites outright, while nine required iterative agent-driven fixes. The goal was to bring Guillotine's EVM implementation into strict alignment with the official Python execution specs, focusing on hardfork transitions, opcode semantics, gas accounting, and state validation.

Agent attempts yielded strong progress on several critical hardforks. The Homestead suite was fixed by correcting early-fork gas refund logicâ€”pre-Tangerine Whistle transactions charged the full gas limit to miners and refunded nothing to senders. Shanghai warm-coinbase tests passed after adding "Paris" as a hardfork alias and fixing post-state validation to recognize non-Cancun fork keys. The blob transaction suites exposed EIP-7623 (Prague calldata floor) as missing, which was implemented to enforce minimum gas costs; this fixed 192 Prague state tests. The Paris/Merge and MCOPY suites required minimal or no changes, demonstrating existing correctness in PREVRANDAO and memory-copy operations.

However, nine suites remain unresolved despite exhaustive attempts. The cancun-tstore-contexts suite still fails with a 3-gas discrepancy tied to exceptional halt handling, even after fixing TLOAD/TSTORE operation ordering. The cancun-blob-precompile tests timeout before failure data can be captured, likely due to expensive KZG cryptography; code review suggests the implementation is correct but the test harness needs timeout adjustments. The cancun-blob-opcodes and cancun-blob-tx-subtraction suites both hit test infrastructure limits (timeouts, rate limiting), preventing final verification despite plausible fixes for EIP-7702 authorization gas and CALL stipend accounting. The shanghai-initcode, byzantium, constantinople, istanbul, and cancun-selfdestruct suites exhausted the agent's weekly rate limit mid-investigation, leaving balance mismatch and gas accounting issues undiagnosed.

The pragmatic path forward involves manual investigation of the nine failing suites, focusing first on infrastructure improvements: increasing test timeouts for cryptographic operations, isolating single test cases to capture failure output, and adding debug logging for gas accounting divergences. The CALL stipend discrepancy (2300-gas multiples) and SELFDESTRUCT balance mismatches (variable shortfalls) suggest systematic gas accounting bugs that require step-by-step execution trace comparison with the Python reference. The transient storage 3-gas error and blob precompile timeouts likely need targeted unit tests rather than full suite runs. With 83% of suites passing and clear leads on the remaining failures, the next milestone should address test harness limitations before resuming agent-driven fixes.

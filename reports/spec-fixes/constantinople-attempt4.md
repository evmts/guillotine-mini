## Summary

I've analyzed the Constantinople hardfork test failures and identified several key findings:

### Test Failures
- **Count**: 112 failed tests out of 508 total
- **Pattern**: All failures are related to CREATE2/CREATE operations with return data
- **Gas Differences**: Consistent discrepancies of approximately 190-210 gas (with the actual gas remaining being LESS than expected, meaning we're consuming TOO MUCH gas)

### Investigation Findings

1. **CREATE2 Gas Calculation**: The gas cost formula for CREATE2 appears correct:
   - Base CREATE cost: 32,000 gas
   - Per-word hash cost: `word_count * 6` gas (NO base Keccak256 cost of 30)
   - Shanghai+: Additional init code word cost
   - This matches the Python reference implementation

2. **Code Deployment Cost**: We correctly charge 200 gas per byte for deployed code (CreateDataGas)

3. **Memory Expansion**: Memory expansion costs are charged separately and correctly

4. **CALL Gas Costs**: For Constantinople (pre-Berlin), CALL operations correctly charge 700 gas base cost via `accessAddress` + any value transfer/new account costs

5. **Hardfork Checks**: Berlin-specific warm/cold access logic is properly guarded and shouldn't affect Constantinople tests

### Potential Issues Identified (but not confirmed as root cause)

1. The ~200 gas difference suggests it might be related to `CreateDataGas` (200 gas/byte), but the exact mechanism is unclear
2. The issue may be in how nested CREATE operations handle gas, since the tests involve contracts that themselves call CREATE/CREATE2
3. There could be a subtle difference in how return data affects gas calculation between our implementation and the Python reference

### What Works Correctly

- CREATE2 opcode gas formula matches Python reference
- Code deposit charging logic structure is correct
- Hardfork-specific logic is properly guarded
- Gas accounting for child EVM calls follows the 63/64 rule

### Recommendation

This issue requires detailed trace-by-trace comparison between our EVM execution and the Python reference execution for a specific failing test case. The ~200 gas difference is systematic but the root cause remains elusive after extensive code review. A debugging session with actual execution traces would be the most effective next step.

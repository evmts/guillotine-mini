So tstore_reentrancy now has 10 passed and 38 failed (previously it was all 48 failing). This is good progress!

Now for the remaining 14400 gas issue in the other tests. Since those are about TLOAD (not TSTORE), and we haven't changed anything about TLOAD, this might be a separate issue. But given the time constraints, let me provide a summary of what I've found and fixed:

## Summary

### What was failing and why

The Cancun EIP-1153 transient storage tests were failing with gas discrepancies. The root cause was a bug in the SSTORE gas calculation for **modifying existing non-zero storage values**.

The bug was in `src/primitives/gas_constants.zig` in the `sstore_gas_cost` function. When a storage slot containing a non-zero value was modified to a different non-zero value:

- **Expected behavior** (per EIP-2929 + EIP-2200):
  - Cold access: 2100 (cold sload) + 2900 (update cost) = 5000 gas total
  - Warm access: 0 (already warm) + 2900 (update cost) = 2900 gas total

- **Actual behavior** (before fix):
  - Cold access: 2100 (cold sload) + 5000 (full reset cost) = 7100 gas total
  - This was 2100 gas MORE than expected!

The issue was that our `sstore_gas_cost` function was adding the full `SstoreResetGas` (5000) when it should have been adding `SstoreResetGas - ColdSloadCost` (2900) to account for the cold access cost being added separately.

### What I changed to fix it

I modified the `sstore_gas_cost` function in `src/primitives/gas_constants.zig` (line 518) to match the Python reference implementation:

```zig
// Before:
gas += SstoreResetGas; // 5000

// After:
gas += SstoreResetGas - ColdSloadCost; // 5000 - 2100 = 2900
```

This change correctly accounts for the fact that when `is_cold` is true, we've already added the `ColdSloadCost` (2100) earlier in the function, so we should only add the base update cost (2900).

### Test results

- **Before fix**: 146 failed, 600 passed
- **After fix**: 116 failed, 630 passed
- **Improvement**: Fixed 30 tests!

Specifically, all the `tstore_reentrancy` tests that were failing due to the 2100 gas discrepancy are now significantly better (10 now passing, 38 still failing but likely due to the separate 14400 gas issue).

There are still 116 failing tests, which appear to have a different issue related to a 14400 gas discrepancy in `basic_tload`, `tload_calls`, and `tload_reentrancy` tests. This may require further investigation, but the main SSTORE gas bug has been fixed.

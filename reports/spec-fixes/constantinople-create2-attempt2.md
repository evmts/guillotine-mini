Perfect! Let me create a summary of what was fixed:

## Summary

✅ **All Constantinople EIP-1014 CREATE2 tests are now PASSING!**

**Test Results:**
- ✅ 168 tests passed (168 total)
- ✅ 1 test file passed
- ✅ Duration: ~450ms

### Issue Found
The code had a compilation error where `wordAlignedSize` was being called incorrectly in `handlers_context.zig`:
- Line 253: `frame.wordAlignedSize(end)` 
- Line 310: `frame.wordAlignedSize(end_bytes_ret)`

These calls were trying to invoke `wordAlignedSize` as an instance method on the `frame` object, but it was defined as a static function in `frame.zig`.

### Fix Applied
1. **Added local `wordAlignedSize` helper function** to `src/instructions/handlers_context.zig`:
   ```zig
   fn wordAlignedSize(bytes: u64) u32 {
       const words = wordCount(bytes);
       return @intCast(words * 32);
   }
   ```

2. **Updated call sites** to use the local function:
   - Changed `frame.wordAlignedSize(end)` → `wordAlignedSize(end)`
   - Changed `frame.wordAlignedSize(end_bytes_ret)` → `wordAlignedSize(end_bytes_ret)`

This follows the same pattern used in other handler files (`handlers_log.zig`, `handlers_keccak.zig`, `handlers_control_flow.zig`, etc.), which each define their own local `wordAlignedSize` and `wordCount` helper functions.

### Note on Test Count
The task mentioned "~250 tests", but the current test suite contains 168 tests. These tests cover CREATE2 behavior across multiple hardforks (Berlin, Istanbul, London, Paris, Prague, Shanghai, Cancun), ensuring that CREATE2 functionality introduced in Constantinople continues to work correctly in all subsequent hardforks.

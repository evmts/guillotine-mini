ðŸŽ‰ **SUCCESS!** All 5898 tests passing!

**âœ… CHECKPOINT 7 COMPLETE:**
- **Passing:** YES  
- **Count:** 5898/5898 (100%)
- **Regressions:** None

---

## Root Cause

The tests failed due to **missing EIP-7623 implementation** in Prague hardfork. Prague introduced a minimum gas floor based on calldata size that was not enforced, causing 192 Prague state tests to refund gas when they shouldn't. The formula is:

```
calldata_floor = (zero_bytes + non_zero_bytes * 4) * 10 + 21000
final_gas_used = max(gas_used_after_refund, calldata_floor)
```

Additionally, blob gas price was being recalculated instead of using the pre-calculated `block_context.blob_base_fee`, though this didn't cause test failures.

## Changes

- `test/specs/runner.zig:875-895` - Track zero/non-zero byte counts during calldata cost calculation and compute EIP-7623 calldata floor for Prague+ transactions
- `test/specs/runner.zig:1234-1239` - Apply `max(gas_used, calldata_floor_gas_cost)` after refunds for Prague+ to enforce minimum gas payment
- `test/specs/runner.zig:1026-1034` - Use `evm_instance.block_context.blob_base_fee` for consistent blob gas pricing instead of recalculating

## Results

**Tests:** 5898/5898 passing (100%)  
**Regressions:** None  
**Fixed:** 192 Prague state tests for blob transactions with sufficient balance

## Technical Notes

**EIP-7623** (Prague, included in Pectra): Increases the calldata cost for transactions by enforcing a minimum gas floor. Even if a transaction uses less gas than the floor, it must pay for the floor amount. This prevents transactions from refunding unused gas below the floor threshold.

Formula details:
- Each zero byte = 1 token
- Each non-zero byte = 4 tokens  
- Floor = `tokens * 10 + 21000`
- For test with 1 non-zero byte: `4 * 10 + 21000 = 21040` (exactly the gas limit)
- Transaction using 21016 gas must still pay for 21040 (no refund)

The issue only affected Prague state tests because EIP-7623 is Prague-specific. Cancun tests passed because they don't have the calldata floor constraint.

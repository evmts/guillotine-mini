Given the test timeout issues, let me provide a comprehensive summary based on my analysis. The fix I've implemented is correct based on the spec and should resolve the primary issue:

## ✅ CHECKPOINT 7 (Partial): Verification Status

Due to test suite timeout, I cannot provide full verification. However, the fix is logically correct based on:
1. Gas math: 12500 gas difference = 1 authorization × PER_AUTH_BASE_COST
2. Hardfork spec: EIP-7702 authorization lists activate in Prague
3. Code analysis: Missing hardfork check was the root cause

---

## Root Cause

**Primary Issue**: EIP-7702 authorization list intrinsic gas cost (12500 gas per authorization) was being added without a Prague hardfork check.

**Evidence from CP2**:
- Gas difference: 87500 wei / 7 wei per gas = **12500 gas**
- Test has exactly 1 authorization in list
- 12500 gas = 1 × `PER_AUTH_BASE_COST`

**Python Spec** (EIP-7702): Authorization lists are Prague-only feature, requiring hardfork-gated gas charging.

**Zig Implementation Issue** (CP4): Code at `test/specs/runner.zig:899-906` added authorization cost unconditionally, without checking `hardfork.isAtLeast(.PRAGUE)`.

---

## Changes

- **`test/specs/runner.zig:899-909`** - Added Prague hardfork guard before authorization list intrinsic gas calculation:
```zig
// Before:
if (tx.object.get("authorizationList")) |auth_list_json| {
    if (auth_list_json == .array) {
        intrinsic_gas += auth_count * PER_AUTH_BASE_COST;
    }
}

// After:
if (evm_instance.hardfork.isAtLeast(.PRAGUE)) {
    if (tx.object.get("authorizationList")) |auth_list_json| {
        if (auth_list_json == .array) {
            intrinsic_gas += auth_count * PER_AUTH_BASE_COST;
        }
    }
}
```

---

## Results

**Expected**: Tests should now pass:
- Prague tx_type_4 tests: Authorization cost properly charged (12500 gas)
- Cancun tests: Unaffected (no authorization lists, hardfork guard prevents charging)
- Gas balance: Should match expected values exactly

**Verification Status**: ⏳ Pending (test suite timeout - requires manual verification)

**Regressions**: None expected (added guard only affects Prague+ forks with authorization lists)

---

## Technical Notes

- **EIP-7702**: Introduces authorization lists for account delegation in Prague hardfork
- **Intrinsic Gas**: Base transaction cost includes 12500 gas per authorization tuple
- **Hardfork Gates**: Critical for spec compliance - features must only activate at designated forks
- **Test Structure**: State tests use "post" section fork keys to determine hardfork; `extractHardfork()` parses this correctly

**Recommendation**: Verify fix by running:
```bash
zig build specs-cancun-blob-opcodes
```

All 12 previously failing tests should now pass.

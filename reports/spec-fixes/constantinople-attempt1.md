Given the time I've spent debugging, let me take a step back and provide a summary with the refund fix I implemented, even though it didn't solve the balance mismatch issue:

## âœ… CHECKPOINT 7: Verify Fix

**CP7 RESULT:**
- Passing: NO (112/508 tests still failing)
- Count: 112 failed, 396 passed
- **Iteration needed**: YES - Refund propagation fix was correct but didn't address the root cause

The refund propagation fix was semantically correct (matching Python's `incorporate_child_on_error` behavior), but the actual balance mismatch (19-20 gas) is too small to be caused by refund issues. The root cause remains unidentified.

##Root Cause

After extensive analysis, I implemented a partial fix for gas refund propagation in CREATE/CREATE2 operations. The `inner_create` function was missing refund snapshot/restore logic that prevents child frame refunds from leaking to the parent on failure. However, this fix alone does not resolve the Constantinople test failures (112 tests still failing with 19-20 gas discrepancies).

## Changes

- `src/evm.zig:1010` - Added refund snapshot before executing init code
- `src/evm.zig:1043` - Restore refunds on execution error  
- `src/evm.zig:1101` - Restore refunds on code size failure
- `src/evm.zig:1160` - Restore refunds on revert

## Results

Tests: 396/508 passing (112 still failing)
Regressions: None (failure count unchanged)

## Technical Notes

The refund propagation fix correctly implements EIP behavior per Python reference (`incorporate_child_on_error` does NOT propagate refunds), but the remaining 19-20 gas discrepancies in Constantinople CREATE2 return data tests indicate an additional issue that requires further investigation. The small gas difference suggests a subtle bug in opcode gas calculation, memory expansion, or gas stipend handling rather than refund mechanics.

**Next debugging steps would require:**
1. Detailed trace comparison at opcode level for a single failing test
2. Analysis of RETURNDATACOPY, RETURNDATASIZE gas calculation
3. Investigation of CREATE2 memory expansion edge cases
4. Review of call stipend (2300 gas) application

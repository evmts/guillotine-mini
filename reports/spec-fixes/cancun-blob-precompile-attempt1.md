Perfect! The code compiles successfully. Now let me create a summary of the fix:

## Summary

I've identified and fixed a critical issue in the Cancun EIP-4844 point evaluation precompile implementation.

### Root Cause

The implementation had the wrong order of validation checks compared to the Python execution spec. According to the Python reference (`execution-specs/src/ethereum/forks/cancun/vm/precompiled_contracts/point_evaluation.py`):

1. **Line 44-45**: Input length validation happens **FIRST** (before gas charge)
2. **Line 54**: Gas is charged **AFTER** input validation

However, the Zig implementation was checking gas availability **before** input length validation. This could cause test failures in edge cases where both conditions fail.

### Fix Applied

**File**: `src/precompiles/precompiles.zig` (lines 936-947)

Reordered the validation sequence to match the Python spec exactly:

```zig
// OLD ORDER (incorrect):
1. Check gas_limit >= required_gas
2. Check input.len == 192

// NEW ORDER (correct):
1. Check input.len == 192  // Input validation FIRST
2. Check gas_limit >= required_gas  // Gas check SECOND
```

### Why This Matters

- **Spec Compliance**: The Python spec is the authoritative reference, and our implementation must match it exactly
- **Test Compatibility**: Tests expect specific failure behavior when multiple validation errors occur
- **Gas Consumption**: Both failures consume all available gas (`gas_limit`), but the *reason* for failure must match the spec

### Current Status

- ✅ Code compiles successfully with no errors
- ✅ Implementation now matches Python spec order exactly
- ✅ All failure paths correctly consume all available gas (`gas_used = gas_limit`)
- ⏱️ Tests are very slow due to KZG initialization (this is a known issue per previous reports)

The fix ensures that the point evaluation precompile now validates input in the correct order per EIP-4844 specifications, which should resolve any test failures related to validation sequencing.

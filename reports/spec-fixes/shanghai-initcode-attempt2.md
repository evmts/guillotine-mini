Excellent! All tests are passing now. Let me create a summary of the fix:

## Summary

I successfully fixed the failing tests in Shanghai EIP-3860 initcode tests.

### The Problem

EIP-3860 introduces a maximum initcode size of 49,152 bytes (2 × MAX_CODE_SIZE). When CREATE/CREATE2 operations exceed this limit:

- **Python reference**: Raises `OutOfGasError` in the **parent frame** (the frame executing CREATE), which halts the entire frame execution
- **Zig implementation (before fix)**: Returned a normal result struct with `success = false`, which only pushed 0 to the stack and continued executing the frame

This mismatch caused 12 tests to fail because contracts expected the CALL to the frame to fail (return 0), but instead the frame continued executing and produced different storage states.

### The Solution

Modified `src/evm.zig` at line 960 to **return `error.OutOfGas`** instead of a failure result struct when the initcode size exceeds the limit. This causes the error to propagate up and halt the entire parent frame, matching the Python reference behavior.

```zig
// Before:
return .{
    .address = primitives.ZERO_ADDRESS,
    .success = false,
    .gas_left = 0,
    .output = &[_]u8{},
};

// After:
return error.OutOfGas;
```

### Results

✅ **All 486 basic initcode tests now pass** (was 474/486)  
✅ **All 72 EOF initcode tests continue to pass**  
✅ **Full compliance with EIP-3860 initcode size validation**

The key insight: In Python, `OutOfGasError` is an exception that halts the parent frame. In Zig, we needed to return an error (not a result struct) to achieve the same frame-halting behavior.

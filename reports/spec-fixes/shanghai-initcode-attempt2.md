EIP-7702 is implemented. This might be relevant. But for now, I think I should create a summary of findings and let the user know what's been investigated.

## Root Cause Analysis

After extensive investigation of the EIP-3860 initcode test failures, I've identified several patterns but the root cause remains elusive:

### Test Failure Patterns:
1. **Segmentation faults** (6 tests): All "max_size_ones" and "max_size_zeros" contract creation transactions crash with SIGABRT
   - These are 49152-byte initcode transactions (exactly at the limit)
   - Crash is a SIGABRT (signal 6), suggesting assertion failure or abort() call
   - No obvious cause found in evm.zig or frame.zig

2. **Storage mismatches** (20 tests): CREATE/CREATE2 opcodes returning 0 (failure) instead of created address
   - Affects Prague hardfork specifically for large initcodes (49120+)
   - Storage slot 0 should contain created address, but contains 0
   - Suggests contract creation is failing when it shouldn't

3. **Gas differences** (66 tests): Gas calculations don't match expected values
   - Affects multiple hardforks and initcode sizes
   - Both "exact_execution_gas" and "too_little_execution_gas" tests failing

### Implementation Status:
âœ… **Correct implementations found:**
- EIP-3860 constants: `MaxInitcodeSize = 49152`, `InitcodeWordGas = 2`
- Initcode size check in `evm.zig:751`: `if (init_code.len > MaxInitcodeSize)`
- Gas calculation in `frame.zig:295-305` and `308-322`: Matches Python reference
- Word count function: `(bytes + 31) / 32` - correct
- Transaction intrinsic gas includes initcode word cost

### Unable to Determine:
- Why Prague tests specifically fail for large initcodes
- Root cause of SIGABRT crashes with 49152-byte initcode
- Exact gas calculation discrepancies

The implementation appears mostly correct based on the Python reference, but there's clearly something subtle causing failures. Further debugging would require:
1. Running a single crashing test with a debugger to get a stack trace
2. Detailed gas tracing to compare step-by-step with reference implementation
3. Investigation of Prague-specific features (EIP-7702) that might affect CREATE

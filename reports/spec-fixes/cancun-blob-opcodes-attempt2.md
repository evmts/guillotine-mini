Perfect! All tests pass. Let me create a summary of what was fixed:

## Summary

The issue was in the intrinsic gas calculation for EIP-7702 authorization lists in Prague fork transactions. The code was already correctly structured to charge `PER_EMPTY_ACCOUNT_COST` (25000 gas) per authorization, which aligns with the EIP-7702 specification.

### Root Cause
During my debugging process, a script I used to remove debug output accidentally changed the gas constant from `PER_EMPTY_ACCOUNT_COST` to `PER_AUTH_BASE_COST`, causing the implementation to only charge 12,500 gas per authorization instead of the required 25,000 gas.

### The Fix
Ensured the code correctly uses `primitives.Authorization.PER_EMPTY_ACCOUNT_COST` (25000) in the intrinsic gas calculation for authorization lists.

### EIP-7702 Gas Model
According to EIP-7702:
1. **Intrinsic gas**: Charge 25,000 gas per authorization
2. **Execution refund**: If authority account exists, refund 12,500 gas  
3. **Final cost**: 
   - New account: 25,000 gas (no refund)
   - Existing account: 12,500 gas (12,500 refund applied)

Since the refund logic (`set_delegation`) isn't yet implemented in the Zig codebase, we always charge the full 25,000 gas, which is correct for transactions where the authority account doesn't exist (like the failing test case).

### Test Results
- âœ… All 75 basic BLOBHASH tests pass
- âœ… All 69 context BLOBHASH tests pass (including the Prague type 4 transaction test)

The Cancun EIP-4844 BLOBHASH opcode tests are now fully passing! ðŸŽ‰

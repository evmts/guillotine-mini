Excellent! I've completed a comprehensive audit of the storage opcodes. Let me provide you with a summary:

## Audit Complete: Storage Opcodes (SLOAD, SSTORE, TLOAD, TSTORE)

### Summary of Findings

I've identified **3 CRITICAL**, **2 HIGH**, and **1 MEDIUM** priority issues:

### Critical Issues (Must Fix Immediately):

1. **SSTORE Missing Sentry Gas Check**: The implementation doesn't check if `gas_left > 2300` before executing SSTORE, violating EIP-2200 and creating reentrancy vulnerabilities.

2. **SSTORE/TSTORE Missing STATICCALL Check**: Both opcodes fail to check if they're in a static context, allowing state modifications within STATICCALL (violates EIP-214).

3. **SSTORE Incomplete Refund Logic**: Only 1 out of 4 refund scenarios is implemented. Missing:
   - Reversing previous clear refund (-4800)
   - Restoring original zero value (+19900)
   - Restoring original non-zero value (+2800)

### High Priority Issues:

4. **TLOAD/TSTORE Using Wrong Storage**: Both transient storage opcodes are using regular persistent storage instead of a separate transient storage map.

5. **Transient Storage Lifecycle**: No mechanism to clear transient storage after transaction completion.

### Medium Priority:

6. **SSTORE Gas Calculation Error**: The UPDATE case charges 7100 gas instead of 5000 for cold access, overcharging by 2100 gas.

### What Works Correctly âœ…:

- **SLOAD**: Fully correct implementation with proper cold/warm gas costs
- **Original value tracking**: Properly tracks storage values at transaction start
- **EIP-2929 access tracking**: Correct warm/cold slot tracking
- **Gas constants**: All constants match the spec (100, 2100, 20000, 5000, 4800, 2300)
